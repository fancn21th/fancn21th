ðŸ˜€ Welcome !

I planed to create a series of webites for demostration, education, thinking-in of modern frontend development workflow.  

It will stat with skeleton.fancn21th.cn with source code pattern at github.com/fancn21th/skeleton. This website will play as a role of building block of other websites like LEGO. And it based on the atmoic design. 

And then anatomy.fancn21th.cn will play as a workflow of how a website should be designed and implemented. Through it I want to see the minimal and critical steps for a website craftment.

I also wish to have some of the demo from my work focus. Like LLMs client app. Some of the feature is rellay challenging for those who is new to web development. I want to see why it is hard for them.

After all of them.  I want to dig into generative art with no boundary and limit.
