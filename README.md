ðŸ˜€ Welcome !

I planed to create a series of webites for demostration, education, thinking-in of modern frontend development workflow.  

It will stat with skeleton.fancn21th.cn with source code pattern at github.com/fancn21th/skeleton. This website will play as a role of building block of other websites like LEGO. And it based on the atmoic design. 

And then anatomy.fancn21th.cn will play as a workflow of how a website should be designed and implemented. Through it I want to see the minimal and critical steps for a website craftsmanship.

I also wish to have some of the demo from my work focus. Like LLMs client app. Some of the feature is really challenging for those new to web development. Why it is hard for them is what I am after.

Above all.  Digging into generative art with no boundary and limit is always the path I keen to proceed.
