ðŸ˜€ Welcome !

new:  Inevitably I have to rethink about the UI framework for AI trends. Now I have different perspective after I studied [design-systems-101](https://designsystemuniversity.teachable.com/courses/design-systems-101/lectures/52895393).

I was trying to create the UI framework in advance however [Dan mall ](https://danmall.com/) claimed the design system should emerge afterwards. In other words, UI framework is a product of something you recreate based on what you already have and do not want to do it again. 

So I think the core value of UI framework is not style part and must be logic part. There are so many great style part solution like shadcn. However the logic part had no paradigm. React or Vue is a paradigm for not care how data is rendered. But not a paradigm when you want to express the logic part in a easily understandable way. So I think maybe I should combine shadcn + xstate, together it is the core of an resuable UI framework for AI and AI only.
