ðŸ˜€ Welcome !

After studying Design Systems 101, my perspective on UI frameworks has evolved. I initially aimed to create a UI framework proactively, but Dan Mall argues that design systems should emerge afterwardsâ€”as a distilled product of what youâ€™ve already built and want to stop rebuilding.

This shifted my thinking: the core value of a UI framework isnâ€™t in the styling, but in the logic. Styling can be elegantly handled by tools like shadcn, but the logic layer lacks a standard paradigm.

React and Vue provide paradigms for rendering structure, but when it comes to managing pure UI logic, especially flows, it ends up scattered across files, like hooks, and context providers. Thereâ€™s no unified structure.

Thatâ€™s where XState comes in. It offers a way to model UI behavior explicitly and predictably. By combining shadcn for styling and XState for UI logic, we can create a reusable, declarative UI framework tailored for AI applicationsâ€”not just another component library, but a both event and data driven system.

Let's try.
