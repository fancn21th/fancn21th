ðŸ˜€ Welcome !

<span style="text-decoration-line: line-through;"> I planed to create a series of webites for demostration, education, thinking-in of modern frontend development workflow.  

It will start with skeleton.fancn21th.cn and you could find the source code at [skeleton](https://github.com/fancn21th/skeleton). This website will play as a role of building block of other websites like LEGO. And it based on the atmoic design. 

And then anatomy.fancn21th.cn will play as a workflow of how a website should be designed and implemented. Through it I want to see the minimal and critical steps for a website craftsmanship.

I also wish to have some of the demo from my work focus. Like LLMs client app. Some of the feature is really challenging for those new to web development. Why it is hard for them is what I am after.

Digging into generative art with no boundary and limit is always the path I keen to proceed. </span>

Dang it stick to xyzChat and bear with me it is mixed with trends of AI and full workflow from Design System I promised above and Storybook and Component Library based on shadcn.
